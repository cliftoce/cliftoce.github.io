    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>My journey as a photographer began in 2005 when I took my first digital camera, the chunky 2MP point-and-shoot Canon A40, on a four-month trip to Kenya and Tanzania. Enthralled by the amazing wildlife of East Africa, I quickly became hooked on photographing it.  I took the same camera to Australia in 2006 and enjoyed capturing many more memories of foreign flora and fauna.</p>
    <p>Some years later, I upgraded to a new point-and-shoot, the Canon A710-IS, and my first DSLR, the Nikon D40.  These traveled with me back to Kenya in 2009, as well as to various locations in the states. </p>
    <p>I have an underwater housing for my point-and-shoot and have taken it on a hundred-foot SCUBA dive, among other aquatic adventures.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, I primarily shoot a Nikon D7000.  For information about my lenses, etc., refer to the complete list of my <a href="equipment">photography equipment</a>.
    <p>I have photographed two weddings (once as a hired contractor and once as a gift to friends) and, during two years at <a href="https://www.whitman.edu/" target="_blank">Whitman College</a>, I was a photographer for the <a href="https://www.whitman.edu/newsroom/whitman-magazine" target="_blank">Whitman Magazine</a>.</p>
