    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Beginning in 2002, I took private violin lessons and played in an orchestra.  In 2007, I transitioned to playing in the Clackamas Community College Chamber Ensemble.  Also in 2007, I sponteneously decided to learn the mandolin, so I picked up a cheap one and began to teach myself; however, it wasn't until a few years later that I really got into it.  I started learning the 5-string banjo in 2012, followed by the Irish tenor banjo in 2014.</p>
    <p>These days, the mandolin is my go-to instrument, but I still bring out the others from time to time.  I especially enjoy Celtic music, but also play some classical and bluegrass.</p>
