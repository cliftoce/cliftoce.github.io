    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I have been a hobbyist woodworker for many years.  Most of my recent projects have been done on a wood-lathe, but I have also used other tools to make such things as wooden practice weapons for <a href="aikido">aikido</a>, small boxes, and even furniture.</p>
    <p>I own a mini wood-lathe, which I first got for the purpose of making my own replacement violin pegs for an old violin that I bought at an estate sale.  I have used it more recently to produce wooden sound chambers for <a href="headphones">custom-built headphones</a>.  However, that particular task is better suited to a full-sized wood-lathe, which I have been fortunate enough to have access to occasionally.</p>
