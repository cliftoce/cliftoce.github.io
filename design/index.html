    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I occasionally create T-shirt designs to enter in the weekly <a href="http://shirt.woot.com/derby" target="_blank">Shirt.Woot! Derby</a>.  I became especially involved with this during the summer of 2011 and have continued to produce designs periodically since then.</p>
    <p>Check out the <a href="shirts">gallery of my shirt designs</a>.</p>
    <p>Most of my graphic design is done in Photoshop.  I have also experimented with simple 3D modeling and animation in <a href="http://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>, as well as vector graphics in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
