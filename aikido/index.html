    <br>
    <p>I have been practicing the Japanese martial art of Aikido since August 1999 (discounting a few-month stint in 1996 that I can hardly remember).  My home dojo is <a href="http://aikidonw.com/" target="_blank">Aikido Northwest</a> in Milwaukie, OR.</p>
    <p>During two years at Whitman College, I founded and served as instructor for the first Whitman Aikido Club.</p>
    <p>During five years at The University of Kansas, I served as an instructor (as well as President for one year and VP for two years) for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204547131/" target="_blank">KU Ki-Aikido Club</a>.  I also trained at the affiliated <a href="http://kansaskisociety.org/" target="_blank">Kansas Ki Society</a> dojo in Lawrence, KS.</p>
