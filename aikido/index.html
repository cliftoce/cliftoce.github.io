    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I have been practicing the Japanese martial art of Aikido since August 1999.  I presently hold the rank of <em>Nidan</em>, second degree black belt.</p>
    <p>I am a student of Craig Fife Sensei, the founder and chief instructor of <a href="http://aikidonw.com/" target="_blank">Aikido Northwest</a> in Milwaukie, OR.  Aikido Northwest follows the system and curriculum of the <a href="http://www.aikikai.or.jp/eng/information/" target="_blank">Aikikai Hombu Dojo</a> (the world headquarters of the Aikikai Foundation) in Tokyo, Japan. Within the US, Aikido Northwest is an affiliated dojo of the California Aikido Association (CAA). The CAA is is structured in three divisions, each comprised of dojos throughout the United States and countries abroad. Aikido Northwest is part of Division II, headed by Frank Doran Shihan.</p>
