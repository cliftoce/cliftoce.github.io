				<strong>August 2, 2010</strong> – Nidan Essay: "The Establishment and Development of the Whitman Aikido Club"
				<div style="padding:8px 0 8px 0; font-size:12px;">
					<em>The college town of Walla Walla, in southeastern Washington, is a small place.   Its surrounding wheat fields outnumber its gas stations and, as I despairingly found out in March 2008, it does not have any aikido dojos.  No aikido?  Well, at least not at the time that I made searches across the Internet during the first few weeks after mailing in my decision to attend Whitman College.  Nor had the situation changed several months later, when I arrived for my first semester as a transfer student.  Try as I might wish that a dojo would pop into existence, the absence of aikido in Walla Walla remained a hard truth; a truth, however, that I was not prepared to live with.</em>&nbsp; <strong>[<a href="Nidan.pdf" target="_blank">read more</a>]</strong>

				<strong>February 9, 2008</strong> – "The Courage to Lead, the Power to Succeed: An Exploration of the Admirable<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attributes of One of History’s Greatest Martial Artists."
				<div style="padding:8px 0 8px 0; font-size:12px;">
					<em>Literally meaning “the way of the warrior,” bushido was more than just a code of conduct for Samurai, the elite combatants of feudal Japan.  Combining the pacifistic beliefs of Buddhism, Zen, Confucianism, and Shintoism, with the alertness and skill needed to survive in a hostile martial environment, bushido was an honorable protocol to which all Japanese men aspired.  Above all, defined as a set of values on which the Samurai based their every action, and holding such intangible characteristics as “justice, benevolence, love, sincerity, honesty, and self-control in utmost respect,” bushido represented a complete way of life for the warrior class.  Sadly, in modern times, it is a way of life that is little understood and technically as extinct as the generations of men who established it.  Yet, as recently as the 20th century, one man took bushido so seriously that, in his lifetime, he embodied, refined, and completely redefined it.</em>&nbsp; <strong>[<a href="Ueshiba.pdf" target="_blank">read more</a>]</strong>

				<strong>April 13, 2007</strong> – Shodan Essay: "Reflections on the Significance of a White Belt"
				<div style="padding:8px 0 8px 0; font-size:12px;">
					<em>I sat quietly on my knees, watching intently as the instructor demonstrated a technique.  Watching the demonstration was the easy part, and even as I tried to concentrate, my thoughts strayed to a contemplation of what I knew would follow.  When the instructor finished the demonstration, the students in the class, of which I was one, would break into pairs and attempt to practice the technique that had just been shown.  This would seem simple, except that as a new student in this dojo I was having an exceptionally difficult time finding people who would train with me.  I was ten years old, and had been practicing Aikido since I was eight.  I had recently been promoted to a new rank, and was allowed to wear a blue belt.  I was allowed, at least, until I came to Guam."</em>&nbsp; <strong>[<a href="Shodan.pdf" target="_blank">read more</a>]</strong>

				<strong>December 4, 2006</strong> – "The True Meaning of <em>Warrior</em>"
				<div style="padding:8px 0 8px 0; font-size:12px;">
					<em>The definition, “one who is engaged in or experienced in battle,” given by fourth edition of The American Heritage Dictionary, might seem like an adequate description of the term warrior.  However, the true meaning of the expression is more abstract.  Words that describe a warrior might include: brave, selfless, heroic, but many people possess these qualities.  Embodiment of a true warrior entails much more.  Throughout history, societies have held different opinions about what makes a person a warrior. To some, a warrior is the heroic knight from eleventh-century England, decked out in his shining mail; while to others, it is the magnificent samurai from feudal Japan, clad in bamboo armor and holding a large curved sword, or the dark-skinned African hunter from modern Kenya, carrying a heavy spear.  Examining the term from these different cultural viewpoints gives a better understanding of the true significance of a warrior.</em>&nbsp; <strong>[<a href="Warrior.pdf" target="_blank">read more</a>]</strong>
