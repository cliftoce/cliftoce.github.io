    <h3>Technology Skills:</h3>
    <br />
    I have a strong background in modern computer technology.  Beyond Python, C++, XML, HTML/CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, and the basic software associated with all standard desktop and mobile operating systems, I have specialized experience with the following tools.
    <br />
    <br />
    <ul>
     <li><strong><a name="latex"><a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX</a></a></strong> is a markup language used extensively by scientists due to its exceptional quality as a typesetting system for technical documentation (in particular, mathematics).  Although initially daunting, the language is quickly mastered due to its intuitive syntax.  The ability to easily define customized functions and environments provides the advanced user with endless opportunities for workflow refinement.  I have used LaTeX for typesetting my own homework assignments in advanced courses, exams and quizzes for my students, published papers, my CV, and much more. <a href="http://guides.macrumors.com/Installing_LaTeX_on_a_Mac" target="_blank">Here's a guide</a> to installing LaTeX on a Mac; similar information exists for other operating systems.</li>
     <br />
     <li><strong><a href="https://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/wiki/Home" target="_blank">Beamer</a></strong> is a LaTeX class for creating slide-based technical presentations.  It is the "mathematician's PowerPoint," and is used in other sciences as well.  I use Beamer to generate slides whenever I give a mathematical talk  that incorporates digital visual aids.</li>
     <br />
     <li><strong><a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">MATLAB</a></strong>, short for <em>matrix laboratory</em>, is a programming environment specifically designed for large-scale matrix manipluations, algorithm development, numerical simulation, and data analysis. With a background of writing code in C++, I find the language itself to be quite straightforward.  I have primarily used MATLAB to develop numerical simulations that support the theoretical results of my research on stochastic systems.</li>
